The DevMountain Housing Portal is a complete solution for managing student housing.

Administrators can add students, other admin users, create cohorts (a group of students), and manage properties. 

A full list of students can be viewed, and a powerful filter allows admins to quickly and easily find any student based on five different criteria.

A drag and drop feature allows admin users to add or remove students from specific apartments with ease.
